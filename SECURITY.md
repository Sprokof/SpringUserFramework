# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

Your security is important to us. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please let us know right away.

### How to Report

- **Non-sensitive issues:** If the issue is not sensitive, please [create an issue](https://github.com/devondragon/SpringUserFramework/issues) directly in this repository.

- **Sensitive issues:** If you believe the issue is sensitive, **do not create a public issue**. Instead, please send an email directly to [devon@justblackmagic.com](mailto:devon@justblackmagic.com).

### Response Time

I aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerabilities within 48 hours and to provide a more detailed response within 72 hours. Cirumstances may delay things (if I am traveling or offline for example).

Thank you for helping us ensure the security and privacy of our users.
